# Fullstack Project: Hypothesis Statements

When beginning a scientific experiment using the Scientific Method, we start with a _hypothesis_: what do we expect to happen in our experiment? We then step through a structured process to either _confirm_ or _refute_ that hypothesis.

In a similar way, every product begins with a **hypothesis statement**: an idea of what sort of problem the product might solve and how it does so. This hypothesis should be simple enough to communicate to others quickly, but nuanced enough to drive the vision for a product or suite of products addressing it.

Before you embark on your fullstack project journey, you should work to _confirm_ or _refute_ your own hypothesis. What problems would you like to solve, or challenges would you like help others overcome?

## Instructions

1. **Read the resources below to understand how to form a good hypothesis statement:**

   - [Forming Experimental Product Hypotheses](https://medium.com/agileinsider/forming-experimental-product-hypotheses-85b1d41541c4)
   - [The 5 Components of a Good Hypothesis](https://www.producttalk.org/2014/11/the-5-components-of-a-good-hypothesis/)

2. **Create three well-formatted and clear hypothesis statements for potential fullstack project ideas.**
   - Each hypothesis statement should clearly communicate the problem your project would address and how it does so.
   - Ensure each statement is unique, reflecting three different project ideas.
3. **Prepare to narrow down these three ideas to a single one as you work to confirm the validity of each hypothesis in upcoming assignments.**

## Hypothesis Statements

### Hypothesis Statement 1:

- **Problem**:
  - Harry Potter fans often struggle to find other enthusiasts with whom they can connect and share their passion for the series. Existing social media platforms are too broad, making it difficult for fans to find and engage with like-minded individuals who are specifically interested in Harry Potter.
- **Solution**:
  - Develop a dedicated platform for Harry Potter fans that centers around a Harry Potter-themed profile and story creator. Users can either use AI to generate their profiles and stories or custom-build them by entering their own data. Additional features will include a messaging app and forums for discussions, enabling fans to connect, share experiences, discuss theories, and participate in community events.
- **Users/Beneficiaries**:
  - The primary users of this platform will be Harry Potter fans of all ages who are looking for a community to share their interest in the Harry Potter series. Additionally, people who are curious about the world of witches and wizardry and want to learn more from dedicated fans will also benefit.
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - The platform will foster a strong and engaged community where Harry Potter fans can create lasting friendships, participate in meaningful discussions, and enhance their overall fan experience. Users will enjoy creating unique profiles and stories that reflect their connection to the Harry Potter universe. Over time, this community will grow and become a go-to destination for all things related to Harry Potter.
- **Success Metrics**:
  - Success will be measured by the number of sign-ups, the level of user engagement (e.g., the number of profiles and stories created, messages sent, forum posts created, and interactions in community events), and the rate of user retention. Additionally, the platform's growth can be gauged by tracking shares on social media and word-of-mouth recommendations. High levels of consistent usage and positive feedback from the community will indicate the platform's success. Metrics such as the number of AI-generated profiles and stories versus custom-built ones can provide insights into user preferences and engagement.

### Hypothesis Statement 2:

- **Problem**:
  - Traditional messaging apps often lack a visual and interactive component, making them feel static and less engaging. Users may find it difficult to express their individuality and creativity within these platforms. Additionally, the sense of community and immersion can be limited in standard text-based chat rooms.
- **Solution**:
  - Develop a messaging app that features customizable virtual chat rooms where users can create and personalize their avatars. These avatars can move around the virtual room using the "WASD" keys, allowing for a more dynamic and interactive chat experience. Users can join different rooms, each with unique themes and customization options, fostering a more engaging and visually stimulating environment.
- **Users/Beneficiaries**:
  - The primary users of this platform will be individuals looking for a more interactive and visually appealing messaging experience. This includes gamers, creative communities, and anyone who enjoys personalizing their online interactions. Additionally, groups looking for a fun and engaging way to communicate and collaborate will benefit from this app.
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - The platform will create a more engaging and immersive messaging experience, encouraging users to spend more time interacting and exploring different chat rooms. The ability to customize avatars and rooms will foster creativity and self-expression, leading to a vibrant and active user community. Over time, the app will become a popular choice for those seeking a unique and interactive alternative to traditional messaging platforms.
- **Success Metrics**:
  - Success will be measured by the number of active users, the frequency of room visits, and the level of user engagement within the chat rooms (e.g., the number of messages sent, interactions between avatars, and room customizations). User retention rates and the growth of new users joining the platform will also be key indicators. Additionally, tracking the creation and customization of avatars and rooms can provide insights into user preferences and engagement levels. Positive user feedback and high ratings on app stores will further validate the platform's success.

### Hypothesis Statement 3:

- **Problem**:
  - Music enthusiasts lack engaging platforms for interactive live DJ sessions where they can actively participate and request songs. Existing platforms may not offer a seamless integration of live music and interactive user engagement.
- **Solution**:
  - Develop an online DJ session and chat room app where users can join live DJ sessions, interact with DJs and other listeners in real-time, and request songs directly to the DJ. The chat room will be designed as a virtual space where users can customize their avatars and move them around, enhancing the interactive experience.
- **Users/Beneficiaries**:
  - Music enthusiasts who enjoy live music experiences and want to interact with DJs and fellow listeners in a virtual environment will benefit from this app. DJs looking for a platform to engage with their audience and receive real-time feedback on song choices will also find value in this application.
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - The platform will offer an immersive and interactive environment for music enthusiasts to enjoy live DJ sessions, request songs, and socialize with other participants. The integration of customizable avatars and virtual rooms will enhance user engagement and create a vibrant community around live music experiences.
- **Success Metrics**:
  - Success will be measured by the number of active users during DJ sessions, the frequency and volume of song requests, and the level of interaction within the chat rooms. User feedback on DJ performance and app usability will be critical indicators of user satisfaction. Additionally, monitoring user retention rates and growth in session attendance will provide insights into the platform's popularity and success.
